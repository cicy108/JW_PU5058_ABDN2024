This is the course review of PU5058 University of Aberdeen.

I have had a very unforgettable experience studying the introduction to health data science course.

This course is far more than an 'introduction'. I benefit a lot.

I will remember those days I read the papers, composed proposals, and submit assessment! I cherish the time with teachers and classmates. 

Although far from online, I will take what I learned, off the screen, to my future plan. 

Good luck!

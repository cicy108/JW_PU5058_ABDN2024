1. What is the maximum value of the blood test result?
SELECT max(result)
FROM blood_test_results

2. What is the average value of each biochem test result?
SELECT test, avg(result)
FROM biochem_test_results
GROUP BY test

3. Return the postcodes and the number of people who live there according to the demographics table.
SELECT postcode, count(*) 
FROM demographic 
GROUP BY postcode

4.  Return all the rows from the demographic table and their corresponding SIMD values from the simd table.
SELECT * 
FROM demographic
JOIN simd 
ON demographic.postcode = simd.postcode

5.  Return the number of people grouped by their SIMD value.
SELECT simd.decile, count(*)
FROM demographic 
JOIN simd
ON demographic.postcode = simd.postcode
GROUP BY simd.decile

6. Return the first and last names and CHI numbers of the people who tested positive for infection (infection_test_results table).
SELECT demographic.first_name, demographic.last_name, demographic.chi 
FROM infection_test_results
JOIN demographic
ON infection_test_results.chi = demographic.chi
WHERE result = 'positive'

7. Return the first and last name, and type and number of biochemical tests each person in the demographic table had. (Think carefully: what do you need to “GROUP BY” here?)
SELECT demographic.first_name, demographic.last_name, biochem_test_results.test, count(*) 
FROM biochem_test_results
JOIN demographic
ON biochem_test_results.chi=demographic.chi
GROUP BY biochem_test_results.test,demographic.first_name, demographic.last_name

8. Return the number of people who have both biochemical and infection test results. (Think about how to make sure you only count each patient once.)
SELECT count(DISTINCT demographic.chi)
FROM demographic
JOIN biochem_test_results
ON biochem_test_results.chi=demographic.chi
JOIN infection_test_results
ON infection_test_results.chi=demographic.chi
